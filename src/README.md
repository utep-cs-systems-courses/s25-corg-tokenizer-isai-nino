Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# How to use it
This tokenizer has 3 commands: 

**history:**
This command prints the entire history of stored tokens from the words you have typed.

**!id:** 
This command prints **only 1** token according to the number you give it (i.e. !15).
If the id is not related with an item in the history or is not a number, it will 
not print any item. (i.e. !ab).

**quit:**
This command frees the tokens and history and then stops the program.
